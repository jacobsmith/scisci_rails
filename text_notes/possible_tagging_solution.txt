        project_id < index on
        source_id < index on
        note_id < index on
        tags : string

        scenario: search for all notes with tag 'foobar'

        scope is limited to a single project (imposition by design)
          find all tags of project
            iterate through them looking for tag

    -- quit worrying about pre-optimization. If it takes too long, get another server. It's going to be distributed. Breathe. (:

      Way too messy to try and implement and understand at this point. Perhaps someone who knows databases and Rails very well could help, but it is more than I can achieve on my own. Thus, I'm going to look at a "two way join with an intermediate model," a simpler and more proven approach to the problem, even if it is slightly more inflexible at this point.

Ex. of two way join w/ intermediate model

        class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :post_tags
        has_many :tags, :through => :post_tags
        end

        class Tag < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many :post_tags
        has_many :posts, :through => :post_tags
        end

        class PostTag < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :post
        belongs_to :tag
        end

Query based on something akin to `where :project = @project`

class Note
  has_many :note_tags
  has_many :tags, through: :note_tags
end

class Tag
  has_many :note_tags
  has_many :notes, :through :note_tags
end

class NoteTag
  belongs_to :note
  belongs_to :tag
end

Which would give us:

    Note:  Note_id Note_Tags_id         NoteTags: Note_id Tag_id            Tag: id
